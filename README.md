# object-detection
This is a python project for detecting and recognizing 
pre-defined, pre-trained objects in real timeor from a video file input.
It also takes screenshots of the detected objects and save it as a bmp file.

The tools used here are : 
Open cv 2.4.13
Python 2.7.11
Numpy 1.9.1

Make sure you have included video.py and common.py file in your python folder.

Also rename the opencv_ffmpeg.dll file from the opencv/sources/3rdparty to 
opencv_ffmpeg2413.dll and copy it to the python directory
inoder to read video from a file.

Now download all the haarcascade xml files provided here to your pc
and plug in the location to the code.

Now i guess you are good to go!

Feel free to mess with the code...
and let me know of any great modifications that you made
